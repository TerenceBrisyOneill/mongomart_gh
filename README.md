This is an online tutorial offered by university.mongodb.com/courses: mongodb for node.js developers. 
Focuses on learning mongodb but also looks at Express and obviously node.js
I completed this course by 12.2018, which was a seven week course,
and would say that it was not difficult for the weekly module completion, but the two projects at the end may catch you by surprise,
in relation to time allowed for completion. I've decided to place this on github just to show my exposure to mongodb, but in all honesty 
i'll need to get back and have a look at all the code and practice my mongodb and nodejs skills - I haven't had a peek since Dec 2017.
